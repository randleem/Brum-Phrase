# Brum-Phrase

_23rd October 2020_
_Week 5 at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk)_

This was our week 5 Friday hackathon at the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk) which was Object Oriented Programming Week

Isabel Holland @hey-irh (my paired-programming partner for the week) and I created Brum Phrase - and OOP inspired Catchphrase game

This was a really difficult but fun hackethon

Isabel and I are planning on refactoring and sorting out the stylings with our new found CSS Skills 😀
